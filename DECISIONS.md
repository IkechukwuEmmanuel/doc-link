# DECISIONS.md

This file logs implementation choices made by the build agent where the PRD was
ambiguous or left a decision open, plus any pre-launch blockers. Per the PRD §0,
ambiguities are resolved toward the simplest, most boring, production-safe option.

## Conventions
- Each entry: **Context → Decision → Rationale**.
- Pre-launch blockers are flagged with **⚠️ BLOCKER**.

---

## Infrastructure & tooling

**Local stack via Docker Compose.** Postgres 16, Redis 7, and MinIO (S3-compatible)
run via `docker-compose.yml`. MinIO is defined from the start though only used from
Phase 3, so infra stays stable across phases.

**Virus scanning (ClamAV).** ⚠️ BLOCKER (deferred to Phase 3): The PRD requires all
uploads to be malware-scanned before being retrievable. The scanning interface will
be defined and wired in Phase 3; if a real ClamAV container is not running, the scan
service is stubbed to mark uploads `pending`→`failed` (NOT `clean`), so nothing is
served unscanned. This stub MUST be replaced with a real scanner before launch.

## Backend

**Package manager: pip + `pyproject.toml`** with a pinned `requirements.txt` for
reproducible installs. Boring and universally supported.

**SQLAlchemy 2.x async + asyncpg + Alembic**, per PRD §6.1.

**Slug generation:** `{adjective}-{noun}-{NN}` with a 2-digit zero-padded number
(10–99 → actually 00–99). Word lists are curated and profanity-filtered. On collision,
regenerate (bounded retries) before widening the number range.

(Phase-by-phase entries appended below as the build proceeds.)

### Phase 1 — Core pad CRUD + slugs
- Pad content stored as a plain `content` TEXT column in Phase 1 (no CRDT yet, per
  PRD phasing). Phase 2 introduces `crdt_snapshot` (bytea) and the WebSocket layer;
  the Phase 1 plain-text path remains as the REST save-on-debounce fallback.
- "Visiting a non-existent valid slug" returns a 404 with a `creatable: true` flag so
  the frontend can show the "create it?" prompt, rather than auto-creating (PRD §5.1).
- Reserved slugs and format validation enforced at the API boundary (Pydantic + a
  validator), independent of the future profanity job in Phase 6.

### Phase 2 — Real-time collaboration (Yjs/CRDT)
- **CRDT server runs in-process in FastAPI** via `pycrdt` + `pycrdt-websocket`
  (a y-websocket-compatible server), rather than a separate Node sidecar. Keeps the
  stack to one runtime and one persistence path. WebSocket endpoint:
  `WS /api/pads/{slug}/ws` (`app/api/ws.py`); one Yjs room per slug.
- **One `Text` named `content` per doc.** On first open a room is seeded from
  `crdt_snapshot` if present, else from the Phase 1 plain `content` column (legacy
  migration path). Changes are flushed on a 1s debounce back to **both**
  `crdt_snapshot` (+ `crdt_snapshot_updated_at`) **and** the plain `content` column,
  so REST `GET`/`PUT`/`/raw` keep working unchanged (`app/services/crdt.py`).
- **No DB migration needed** — `crdt_snapshot`/`crdt_snapshot_updated_at` were
  pre-provisioned in the initial schema.
- **Redis not required in Phase 2.** Single-process in-memory rooms are sufficient;
  multi-node fan-out (Redis pub/sub or a y-redis store) is deferred to scaling work
  in Phase 6.
- **REST `PUT` retained** as the documented save fallback; the live path is now the
  WebSocket. The frontend no longer calls `PUT` on keystroke but `savePad()` remains
  in the API client.
